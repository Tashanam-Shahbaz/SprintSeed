### **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**
### **Task Management System**

---

### **1. INTRODUCTION**

#### **1.1 Purpose and Scope**
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed specification for the Task Management System. This system is a web-based application designed to help individuals and teams create, assign, track, and manage tasks efficiently.

*   **Scope:** The initial version (v1.0) of the system will focus on core functionalities including user management, project creation, task management (CRUD operations), and a central dashboard for an at-a-glance overview.
*   **Out of Scope:** Advanced features such as Gantt charts, time tracking, budget management, and third-party application integrations (beyond placeholder APIs) are considered out of scope for the initial release but are planned for future versions.

#### **1.2 System Overview**
The Task Management System will be developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It will feature a single-page application (SPA) frontend built with React that communicates with a RESTful API backend powered by Node.js and Express.js. All data, including user profiles, projects, and tasks, will be stored in a NoSQL MongoDB database. The architecture is designed for real-time updates, scalability, and maintainability.

### **2. FRONTEND SPECIFICATIONS**

#### **2.1 UI Design Description**
The user interface will be clean, modern, and intuitive, prioritizing ease of use and clarity. The design will employ a minimalist aesthetic with a consistent color palette and typography to minimize cognitive load. Interactive elements will provide clear visual feedback to the user.

#### **2.2 Screen Layouts and User Flows**

*   **Login/Registration Page:**
    *   **Layout:** A centered form with fields for email and password. Links for "Sign Up" or "Log In" will toggle between the two forms.
    *   **Flow:** A new user registers. Upon success, they are redirected to the main dashboard. An existing user logs in and is directed to the dashboard.

*   **Dashboard (Main View):**
    *   **Layout:** A primary navigation bar on the left or top. The main content area will display a summary of "My Tasks" (tasks assigned to the logged-in user) and a list of "Projects" they are a member of.
    *   **Flow:** Users get a quick overview of their workload and can navigate to specific projects.

*   **Project View:**
    *   **Layout:** Displays the project title and description at the top. The main area is a Kanban-style board with columns for task statuses (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done"). Each task is represented as a card that can be dragged and dropped between columns. A button to "Add New Task" will be prominently displayed.
    *   **Flow:** User selects a project from the dashboard. They can view all tasks, update a task's status by dragging it, or click on a task card to see more details.

*   **Task Detail Modal:**
    *   **Layout:** An overlay modal showing the task title, full description, assignee, due date, priority, and status. It will include controls to edit or delete the task (based on user permissions).
    *   **Flow:** User clicks on a task card to open the modal. They can view details or make changes and save them.

#### **2.3 Responsive Design Requirements**
The application must be fully responsive and provide an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. A mobile-first design approach will be used, ensuring core functionality is accessible on smaller screens. Layouts will adapt fluidly to different screen sizes using flexible grids and media queries.

### **3. BACKEND ARCHITECTURE**

#### **3.1 API Specifications and Endpoints**
The backend will expose a RESTful API for all frontend communications. Authentication will be managed via JWTs sent in the Authorization header.

| Method | Endpoint                               | Description                                      |
| :----- | :------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/api/auth/register`                   | Register a new user.                             |
| POST   | `/api/auth/login`                      | Authenticate a user and return a JWT.            |
| GET    | `/api/projects`                        | Get all projects for the authenticated user.     |
| POST   | `/api/projects`                        | Create a new project.                            |
| GET    | `/api/projects/:id`                    | Get details of a specific project.               |
| PUT    | `/api/projects/:id`                    | Update a project's details.                      |
| DELETE | `/api/projects/:id`                    | Delete a project.                                |
| GET    | `/api/projects/:projectId/tasks`       | Get all tasks within a specific project.         |
| POST   | `/api/projects/:projectId/tasks`       | Create a new task within a project.              |
| PUT    | `/api/tasks/:taskId`                   | Update a task's details (status, assignee, etc.).|
| DELETE | `/api/tasks/:taskId`                   | Delete a task.                                   |

#### **3.2 Business Logic Implementation**
*   **User Authentication:** User registration will hash passwords using bcrypt. Login will validate credentials and issue a signed JWT with a limited expiry. Middleware will protect routes by verifying the JWT on incoming requests.
*   **Task Management Logic:**
    *   Task creation requires a valid `projectId`.
    *   Task status updates will be broadcast in real-time to all connected clients viewing that project (using WebSockets/Socket.io).
    *   Permissions for updating or deleting a task will be restricted to the task assignee, the project owner, or a user with a "Project Manager" role.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    *   **Team Member:** Can view projects/tasks and update tasks assigned to them.
    *   **Project Manager:** Can create/update/delete tasks within their projects and manage project members.
    *   **Admin:** Global access to manage all users and projects.

#### **3.3 Integration Points**
The system will be architected to support future integrations. Placeholder modules will be created for:
*   **Google Calendar:** An API endpoint (`/api/integrations/google/sync`) will be stubbed out to handle future OAuth 2.0 flow and sync task due dates to a user's Google Calendar.
*   **Slack:** A webhook handler will be designed to post notifications to a Slack channel when a task is created or its status changes.

#### **TASK 3: Request Processing (Approver Functionality)**

##### **3.3.1 Description and Priority**
**Description:** This feature enables an Approver to view, analyze, and act upon requests that are pending their decision. They can approve or reject a request, which either moves the request to the next step or terminates the workflow.
**Priority:** High

##### **3.3.2 UI/UX Design (Frontend)**
*   **Dashboard/Inbox View:** The Approver's dashboard will feature an "Inbox" or "Pending My Approval" section. This will be a table listing all requests awaiting their action. Columns will include `Request ID`, `Requester Name`, `Template Name`, and `Received Date`.
*   **Detailed Request View:** Clicking on a request opens a detailed, read-only view.
    *   **Top Section:** Displays key information: Requester, Submission Date, and Current Status.
    *   **Middle Section:** Shows all the data submitted by the requester in a clean, easy-to-read format. Any attached files will be available as downloadable links.
    *   **Bottom Section:** An "Action" panel with "Approve" and "Reject" buttons. A `Comments` textarea is provided for the approver to add remarks.
    *   **History/Audit Trail:** A timeline view showing the history of the request (e.g., "Submitted by John Doe," "Approved by Jane Smith - Step 1").

##### **3.3.3 API Endpoints (Backend)**

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/approvals/pending` | Retrieves a list of all requests pending the current user's approval. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/approvals/{requestId}/approve` | Approves a request. The backend logic handles moving to the next step or marking as fully approved. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/approvals/{requestId}/reject` | Rejects a request. The backend logic updates the status and notifies the requester. |

##### **3.3.4 Database Design**

*   **Table: `request_history` (Audit Trail)**
| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `id` | `INT` | PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT | Unique identifier for the history log entry. |
