**STAGE 1: SRS PLAN**

1.  **Project Overview and Scope:** The project will create a centralized, web-based platform to automate employee attendance tracking, manage leave requests, and generate insightful reports for management.
2.  **Primary Objectives and Success Criteria:** The main objective is to eliminate manual tracking errors and provide real-time attendance visibility; success will be measured by a 95% reduction in administrative time spent on attendance and 100% accurate data for payroll integration.
3.  **Key Stakeholders and Target Users:** Key stakeholders are HR Managers and Department Heads, while the primary users include Employees, Line Managers (for approvals), and System Administrators.
4.  **Core Functional Requirements:** The system must include secure user authentication with role-based access, real-time clock-in/out functionality (with optional geolocation), a comprehensive leave management workflow, and a dynamic reporting dashboard.
5.  **Technical Stack Recommendations:** A MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) is recommended for its real-time capabilities and scalability, coupled with a responsive, mobile-first UI design.
6.  **Data Management Approach:** The system will use a NoSQL database (MongoDB) to store user profiles, attendance logs, and leave data, with policies for regular automated backups and data encryption at rest.
7.  **Integration Requirements with Existing Systems:** The system must be designed with a RESTful API to allow for future integration with third-party payroll systems and HRIS platforms.
8.  **Security and Compliance Considerations:** Implementation will enforce strict role-based access control (RBAC), use JWT for session management, encrypt all sensitive data in transit (SSL/TLS), and ensure compliance with local labor laws.
9.  **Potential Challenges or Constraints:** Potential challenges include ensuring accurate time synchronization across diverse client devices, handling offline attendance marking, and driving user adoption across the organization.
10. **Quality Assurance Approach:** A comprehensive testing strategy will be executed, including unit tests for business logic, integration tests for APIs, end-to-end automated tests for user flows, and a final User Acceptance Testing (UAT) phase.
