**STAGE 1: SRS PLAN**

1.  **Project overview and scope:** The project aims to develop a web-based Task Management System (TMS) to allow users to create, track, and manage personal or team-based tasks.
2.  **Primary objectives and success criteria:** The primary objective is to provide an intuitive platform for task organization, with success measured by high user engagement and efficient task completion rates.
3.  **Key stakeholders and target users:** Key stakeholders include individual users, small teams, and project managers who need to organize their work, along with system administrators.
4.  **Core functional requirements:** The system must support user registration/login, task creation/editing, task status updates (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done), and task viewing/filtering.
5.  **Technical stack recommendations:** The recommended technical stack includes a React/Vue.js frontend, a Node.js/Express backend, and a PostgreSQL database.
6.  **Data management approach:** A relational database approach will be used to store structured task data, user profiles, and associated metadata.
7.  **Integration requirements with existing systems:** Initially, no external system integrations are required, but future APIs may be considered for calendar or communication tools.
8.  **Security and compliance considerations:** The system must implement secure user authentication, data encryption for sensitive information, and adhere to basic data privacy principles.
9.  **Potential challenges or constraints:** Potential challenges include ensuring real-time updates for collaborative tasks and managing complex task dependencies efficiently.
10. **Quality assurance approach:** Quality assurance will involve unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure system reliability and usability.
