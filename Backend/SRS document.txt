Based on your request for a "task mgt system," I have outlined a plan to develop a web-based application called "TaskFlow."

1.  **Project Overview and Scope:** The project is to develop "TaskFlow," a web-based task management system designed for individuals and small teams to create, assign, and track the progress of their tasks.
2.  **Primary Objectives and Success Criteria:** The main objective is to provide a centralized and intuitive platform for task organization, with success measured by user adoption rates, task completion velocity, and a system uptime of 99.5%.
3.  **Key Stakeholders and Target Users:** Key stakeholders are the project owner and the development team, with target users being freelancers, students, and managers of small teams who need a simple project tracking tool.
4.  **Core Functional Requirements:** The system will include secure user registration and login, full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for tasks, task organization by projects, and status tracking (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Done).
5.  **Technical Stack Recommendations:** We recommend a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to build a modern, responsive, and scalable single-page application.
6.  **Data Management Approach:** User and task data will be stored in a MongoDB NoSQL database, utilizing a structured schema for users, projects, and tasks, with a policy for regular cloud-based backups.
7.  **Integration Requirements with Existing Systems:** The system will feature an optional integration with Google Calendar API to sync task due dates with the user's personal calendar.
8.  **Security and Compliance Considerations:** Security will be addressed through JWT for stateless authentication, HTTPS to encrypt all data in transit, and industry-standard password hashing (bcrypt).
9.  **Potential Challenges or Constraints:** A key challenge will be ensuring real-time collaboration and updates for teams without sacrificing application performance or user experience.
10. **Quality Assurance Approach:** A comprehensive QA strategy will be employed, including automated unit and integration tests for the backend API and manual end-to-end testing for all user-facing features.
