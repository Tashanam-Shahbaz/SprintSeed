**STAGE 1: SRS PLAN**

1.  **Project Overview and Scope:** The project is to develop a cross-platform task management mobile application ("TaskMaster") for individuals and small teams, excluding advanced enterprise features like SSO or detailed reporting.
2.  **Primary Objectives and Success Criteria:** The primary objective is to enhance user productivity through intuitive task organization, with success measured by a 20% monthly active user growth rate and a 4.5+ star rating in app stores.
3.  **Key Stakeholders and Target Users:** Stakeholders include the project owner and development team, while target users are students, freelancers, and small business professionals seeking a simple organizational tool.
4.  **Core Functional Requirements:** The app will feature secure user authentication, comprehensive task creation and management (CRUD), project-based task grouping, and push notifications for reminders.
5.  **Technical Stack Recommendations:** A recommended stack includes React Native for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend API, and MongoDB for the database to ensure rapid, scalable development.
6.  **Data Management Approach:** All user data will be stored in a cloud-hosted database, with real-time synchronization enabled across all of a user's logged-in devices.
7.  **Integration Requirements:** The application will require one-way integration to push task deadlines to third-party calendars, specifically Google Calendar and Apple Calendar.
8.  **Security and Compliance Considerations:** Security will be enforced through OAuth 2.0 for authentication, JWT for session management, and SSL/TLS encryption for all data in transit.
9.  **Potential Challenges or Constraints:** A key challenge will be maintaining optimal performance and seamless real-time data synchronization across different mobile operating systems and network conditions.
10. **Quality Assurance Approach:** The QA strategy will involve a combination of automated unit/integration tests and manual end-to-end testing on a range of physical iOS and Android devices.
