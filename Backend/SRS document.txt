Of course. Based on your request, here is a detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document for a web-based Workflow Approval System.

This document is generated based on the high-level user query provided. Since no chat history was available, common industry-standard features for such a system have been inferred and included to create a comprehensive specification.

### **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**
### **for**
### **Web-Based Workflow Approval System**

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023

---

### **1. Introduction**

#### **1.1 Purpose**
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description of the requirements for the Web-Based Workflow Approval System. The system's primary objective is to digitize and centralize the approval process, transforming outdated, paper-based or scattered digital methods into a unified, efficient, and transparent web-based platform. This document will guide the design, development, and testing of the software.

#### **1.2 Scope**
The system will provide a platform for administrators to create and manage workflow templates, for users to submit requests based on these templates, and for designated approvers to review, approve, or reject these requests. The system will cover:
*   User authentication and role-based access control.
*   Creation and management of dynamic workflow templates.
*   Submission of approval requests with attachments.
*   A multi-step approval process.
*   Real-time tracking of request status.
*   Email notifications for key events.
*   An audit trail/history for all requests.

The system will **not** include direct integration with third-party financial systems or real-time chat functionality in this version.

#### **1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations**
*   **SRS:** Software Requirements Specification
*   **UI:** User Interface
*   **UX:** User Experience
*   **API:** Application Programming Interface
*   **RBAC:** Role-Based Access Control
*   **Workflow:** A defined sequence of tasks or steps required for an approval process.
*   **Template:** A pre-defined structure of a workflow, including its steps and form fields.
*   **Request:** An instance of a workflow initiated by a Requester.
*   **Requester:** A user who initiates an approval request.
*   **Approver:** A user responsible for approving or rejecting a request at a specific step.
*   **Admin:** A privileged user who manages users, roles, and workflow templates.

#### **1.4 Overview**
This SRS is organized into several sections. Section 2 provides an overall description of the product, its users, and its operating environment. Section 3 details the core system features, broken down into three major tasks, each with its frontend (UI/UX), backend (API), and database specifications. Section 4 outlines the non-functional requirements of the system.

### **2. Overall Description**

#### **2.1 Product Perspective**
The system will be a standalone, self-contained, web-based application. It will be accessible through modern web browsers on desktops and mobile devices. It will manage its own user database and workflow logic.

#### **2.2 User Classes and Characteristics**
The system will have three primary user roles:
1.  **Administrator (Admin):**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Manages the entire system. Creates and manages user accounts and roles. Designs, creates, and modifies workflow templates. Has oversight of all requests in the system.
    *   **Technical Skills:** Should be comfortable with web application interfaces. No programming skills required.

2.  **Requester (Standard User):**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Initiates new approval requests by selecting a template, filling out the required information, and submitting it. Tracks the status of their own submitted requests.
    *   **Technical Skills:** Basic web browsing skills.

3.  **Approver:**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Receives and reviews pending requests assigned to them. Can approve, reject, or add comments to a request. Views the history of requests they have processed.
    *   **Technical Skills:** Basic web browsing skills.
    *   *Note: A user can be both a Requester and an Approver.*

### **3. System Features (The Three Major Tasks)**

This section details the three core functionalities of the system.

---

#### **TASK 1: Workflow Template Management (Admin Functionality)**

##### **3.1.1 Description and Priority**
**Description:** This feature allows Administrators to create, view, update, and delete workflow templates. A template defines the form fields a requester must fill out and the sequence of approval steps. This is the backbone of the system.
**Priority:** High

##### **3.1.2 UI/UX Design (Frontend)**
*   **Main View:** A dashboard screen titled "Workflow Templates" will display a list of all existing templates in a table format. The table will show columns for `Template Name`, `Description`, `Created Date`, and `Status (Active/Inactive)`. Each row will have "Edit" and "Deactivate/Activate" buttons. A prominent "Create New Template" button will be visible.
*   **Creation/Editing View:**
    *   This will be a multi-part form.
    *   **Part 1: Basic Information:** Fields for `Template Name` (text input) and `Description` (textarea).
    *   **Part 2: Form Builder:** An interactive section to define the data-entry form for the requester. The admin can add various field types (e.g., Text, Number, Date, File Upload, Dropdown). Each field will have properties like `Label`, `Field Type`, and a `Required` checkbox.
    *   **Part 3: Approval Steps:** A dynamic, ordered list builder. The admin clicks "Add Step" to create a new approval level. For each step, they can assign one or more specific users or a user role (e.g., "Manager," "Finance Department") as the Approver. A drag-and-drop interface will allow for reordering the steps.
    *   **Actions:** "Save Template" and "Cancel" buttons will be at the bottom of the page.

##### **3.1.3 API Endpoints (Backend)**

#### **TASK 3: Request Processing (Approver Functionality)**

##### **3.3.1 Description and Priority**
**Description:** This feature enables an Approver to view, analyze, and act upon requests that are pending their decision. They can approve or reject a request, which either moves the request to the next step or terminates the workflow.
**Priority:** High

##### **3.3.2 UI/UX Design (Frontend)**
*   **Dashboard/Inbox View:** The Approver's dashboard will feature an "Inbox" or "Pending My Approval" section. This will be a table listing all requests awaiting their action. Columns will include `Request ID`, `Requester Name`, `Template Name`, and `Received Date`.

    *   **Top Section:** Displays key information: Requester, Submission Date, and Current Status.
    *   **Middle Section:** Shows all the data submitted by the requester in a clean, easy-to-read format. Any attached files will be available as downloadable links.
    *   **Bottom Section:** An "Action" panel with "Approve" and "Reject" buttons. A `Comments` textarea is provided for the approver to add remarks.
    *   **History/Audit Trail:** A timeline view showing the history of the request (e.g., "Submitted by John Doe," "Approved by Jane Smith - Step 1").

| `POST` | `/api/v1/approvals/{requestId}/reject` | Rejects a request. The backend logic updates the status and notifies the requester. |

##### **3.3.4 Database Design**

*   **Table: `request_history` (Audit Trail)**
| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
