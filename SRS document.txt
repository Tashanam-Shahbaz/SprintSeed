---

### **1. INTRODUCTION**

#### **1.1 Purpose and Scope**
This document outlines the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for a web-based CSV Data Analyzer application. The purpose of this system is to provide a user-friendly tool for individuals to upload Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files and instantly generate an interactive analytical dashboard. The scope of this project is limited to the functionalities of CSV file uploading, in-memory data processing, dynamic visualization, and data filtering. The application will operate as a standalone tool.

#### **1.2 System Overview**
The CSV Data Analyzer will empower non-technical users to gain insights from their data without needing complex software. Users will upload a CSV file through a web interface. The backend will process this file, automatically identify data types, and prepare a summary. The frontend will then render this data as an interactive dashboard, featuring key performance indicators (KPIs), various charts (bar, line, pie), and filtering controls. The primary success criterion is the system's ability to provide fast, accurate, and interactive data visualizations from user-provided data.

#### **1.3 Definitions and Acronyms**

### **2. FRONTEND SPECIFICATIONS**

#### **2.1 UI Design Description**
The application will feature a clean, minimalist, and modern UI. The design will prioritize ease of use, with clear calls-to-action and intuitive navigation. The primary color palette will be neutral to ensure that the data visualizations (charts) are the main focus. The recommended frontend framework is **React** or **Vue.js** for its component-based architecture, and a charting library like **Plotly** or **Chart.js** for rich, interactive visualizations.

#### **2.2 Screen Layouts and User Flows**

**User Flow:**
1.  **Landing/Upload:** The user arrives at the main page, which prompts them to upload a CSV file.
2.  **Processing:** After selecting a file and clicking "Analyze," a loading indicator is displayed while the backend processes the data.
3.  **Dashboard View:** The user is automatically redirected to the dashboard view, where visualizations of their data are displayed.
4.  **Interaction:** The user can interact with the dashboard by applying filters or hovering over charts for more details.
5.  **Export:** The user can click an "Export" button to download the currently filtered data as a new CSV file.

**Screen Layouts:**

*   **Upload Page:**
    *   **Header:** Application Title ("CSV Data Analyzer").
    *   **Main Content:** A large, clearly marked file drop zone or an "Upload CSV" button.
    *   **Instructions:** Simple text: "Upload a CSV file to generate your dashboard. Max file size: 100MB."
*   **Dashboard Page:**
    *   **Header:** Application Title, name of the uploaded file, and an "Export Data" button.
    *   **Filter Panel (Left Sidebar or Top Bar):** A dedicated section with dropdowns and sliders for each detected categorical or numerical column in the data. A date range picker will be present if a date column is detected.
    *   **Main Content Area (Dashboard):** A grid-based layout displaying:
        *   **KPI Cards:** At the top, showing key metrics (e.g., Total Rows, Average Value of a key column).
        *   **Visualizations:** A series of charts (e.g., Bar chart for categorical counts, Line chart for time-series data, Pie chart for distributions).

#### **2.3 Responsive Design Requirements**
The application must be fully responsive and provide an optimal viewing experience across a range of devices.
*   **Desktop:** Full dashboard view with sidebar for filters and a multi-column grid for charts.
*   **Tablet:** The filter panel may collapse into a hamburger menu. The chart grid may reflow to two columns.
*   **Mobile:** A single-column layout. Filters will be accessible via a button that opens a modal or an off-canvas menu. Charts will stack vertically, and users will scroll to view them.

### **3. BACKEND ARCHITECTURE**

#### **3.1 API Specifications and Endpoints**
The backend will be a stateless REST API built with **Python (Flask/Django)** and the **Pandas** library for data manipulation.

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Request Body | Success Response (200) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **POST** | `/api/upload` | Uploads a CSV file for processing. | `multipart/form-data` with the file. | `{"session_id": "xyz123", "status": "success"}` |
| **GET** | `/api/dashboard/{session_id}` | Retrieves the initial processed data and metadata for the dashboard. | (None) | JSON object with KPIs, chart data, and filter options. |
| **POST** | `/api/dashboard/{session_id}/filter` | Applies new filters and returns updated dashboard data. | JSON with filter criteria: `{"column": "Category", "value": "A"}` | JSON object with updated KPIs and chart data. |
| **GET** | `/api/dashboard/{session_id}/export` | Exports the currently filtered dataset as a CSV file. | (None) | `text/csv` file download. |

#### **3.2 Business Logic Implementation**
1.  **File Ingestion:** The `/api/upload` endpoint receives the CSV file. It validates the file type (must be `text/csv`) and size (e.g., < 100MB).
2.  **Data Processing:** The backend uses Pandas to read the CSV into a DataFrame. It performs the following operations:
    *   Infers data types for each column (numeric, string/categorical, datetime).
    *   Generates summary statistics (count, mean, std, min, max) for numeric columns.
    *   Calculates value counts for categorical columns.
    *   Stores the processed DataFrame in a temporary, session-based cache (e.g., Redis or file system) linked to the `session_id`.
3.  **Filtering Logic:** The `/api/dashboard/{session_id}/filter` endpoint retrieves the DataFrame from the cache, applies the user-specified filters, and recalculates the necessary data for the frontend visualizations.

#### **3.3 Integration Points**
The application is designed as a standalone tool. No external system integrations are required for this version.

### **4. DATABASE DESIGN**

#### **4.1 Database Tables with Schema**
For the core functionality, a traditional persistent database for user-uploaded data is **not required**. The system will operate on a per-session basis, processing data in-memory and storing it temporarily on the server's file system or a cache like Redis. Each user session's data will be isolated and automatically purged after a period of inactivity (e.g., 24 hours).

This approach simplifies data management and enhances privacy, as user data is not stored long-term.

#### **4.2 Data Flow Diagram**
```
[User] -> (1. Upload CSV) -> [Frontend UI]
   ^                                  |
   |                                  v (2. POST /api/upload)
   |                                [Backend API]
   |                                  |
   |                                  v (3. Process with Pandas)
   |                                [In-Memory/Cache Data Store]
   |                                  ^
   |                                  | (4. GET /api/dashboard)
   |                                  |
(6. View & Interact) <--- [Frontend UI] <--- (5. Return JSON Data) <--- [Backend API]
```

#### **4.3 Data Migration Strategy**
Not applicable, as the application does not use a persistent database for user-uploaded data.

### **5. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS**

#### **5.1 Performance Metrics**
*   **Initial Processing Time:** For a CSV file up to 10MB, the time from upload to dashboard display shall be less than 15 seconds.
*   **Filtering Response Time:** API response time for applying a filter on the dashboard shall be under 2 seconds.
*   **Concurrency:** The system shall support at least 50 concurrent user sessions without significant performance degradation.
*   **File Size Limit:** The application will enforce a file size limit of 100MB to maintain performance.

#### **5.2 Security Requirements**
*   **Data Transmission:** All communication between the client and server must be encrypted using HTTPS.
*   **File Upload Validation:** The backend must validate uploaded files to ensure they are of type `text/csv` and within the size limit to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
*   **Data Sanitization:** Input data from the CSV will be handled as data, not executable code. The system must protect against CSV Injection, where cell values containing formulas could be exploited in spreadsheet software if exported.
*   **Session Management:** Each user session must be isolated. The `session_id` should be a cryptographically secure random string. Session data will be automatically deleted after 24 hours of inactivity.
*   **Web Vulnerabilities:** The application must be protected against common web vulnerabilities, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

#### **5.3 Scalability Considerations**
*   **Stateless Backend:** The backend API should be stateless, meaning each request can be handled by any available server instance. This allows for horizontal scaling by adding more application servers behind a load balancer.
*   **Large File Handling:** For future versions intended to handle files >100MB, a background processing queue (e.g., Celery with Redis) should be implemented. This would allow the user to receive an immediate response while the file is processed asynchronously.

#### **Resource Allocation Recommendations:**
*   **Backend Developer (1):** Responsible for Python/Flask API, data processing logic, and security.
*   **Frontend Developer (1):** Responsible for React/Vue UI, state management, API integration, and visualizations.
*   **QA/Testing:** Integrated into the development process by the developers themselves due to the compressed timeline.

#### **Critical Path:**
The critical path involves the parallel but interdependent work of the frontend and backend developers.
**Week 1 (Core Logic & UI) -> Week 2 (Feature Completion & Deployment)**
A delay in either the frontend or backend track during Week 1 will directly impact the ability to start Week 2 tasks and will jeopardize the final delivery date. Constant communication and integration are key.
