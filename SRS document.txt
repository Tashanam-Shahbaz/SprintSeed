To create a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document based on the user query "provide me a portfolio of me," we need to outline the necessary components that would typically be included in such a document. The user's query suggests a system that can generate a personal portfolio, possibly a digital one. Below is a structured SRS document based on this understanding:

**Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Document**

**1. Introduction**

1.1 Purpose  
The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for a system that generates a personal portfolio for users. This system will allow users to input their personal and professional information and generate a comprehensive portfolio that can be shared digitally.

1.2 Scope  
The system will be a web-based application that enables users to create, customize, and share their personal portfolios. The application will support various media types, including text, images, and links to external content.

1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations  
- **Portfolio**: A collection of documents and media that represent a person's skills, achievements, and experiences.
- **User**: An individual who uses the system to create a portfolio.
- **Admin**: An individual with administrative privileges to manage the system.

1.4 References  
- Web development best practices
- User interface design guidelines

1.5 Overview  
This document includes the overall description, specific requirements, and other supporting information necessary for the development of the portfolio generation system.

**2. Overall Description**

2.1 Product Perspective  
The portfolio generation system will be a standalone web application that can be accessed via a web browser. It will integrate with social media platforms and cloud storage services for importing and exporting data.

2.2 Product Functions  
- User registration and authentication
- Profile creation and management
- Portfolio template selection and customization
- Media upload and management
- Portfolio sharing via link or social media

2.3 User Characteristics  
The primary users are individuals seeking to create a professional portfolio. Users should have basic computer literacy and internet access.

2.4 Constraints  
- The system must comply with data protection regulations.
- The application should be responsive and accessible on various devices.

2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies  
- Users have access to the internet.
- Users have digital content to include in their portfolios.

**3. Specific Requirements**

3.1 Functional Requirements

- The system shall provide a user-friendly interface for entering personal and professional information.
- The system shall offer multiple templates for portfolio design.
- The system shall support uploading images, documents, and videos.
- The system shall allow users to preview and edit their portfolios before finalizing.
- The system shall generate a shareable link for the completed portfolio.

3.2 Non-Functional Requirements  
- The system shall be available 99.9% of the time.
- The system shall load pages within 3 seconds.
- The system shall ensure data security and user privacy.

3.3 Interface Requirements  
- The user interface shall be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- The system shall be compatible with major web browsers.

**4. Other Requirements**

4.1 Performance Requirements  
- The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.

4.2 Security Requirements  
- The system shall use HTTPS for secure data transmission.
- The system shall implement user authentication and authorization.

4.3 Software Quality Attributes  
- Usability: The system should be easy to use for individuals with basic computer skills.
- Reliability: The system should function correctly under normal usage conditions.
