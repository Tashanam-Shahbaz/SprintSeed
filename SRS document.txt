# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the requirements for developing a data analytics dashboard that will process and visualize data from CSV files. The dashboard will enable users to gain insights through interactive visualizations and analysis tools.

### 1.2 Scope
The dashboard will provide a comprehensive view of CSV data through various visualization techniques, filtering capabilities, and analytical functions. It will be designed to handle different types of data and provide customizable views for analysis.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **CSV**: Comma-Separated Values file format
- **Dashboard**: Visual display of key data points and metrics
- **KPI**: Key Performance Indicator
- **UI**: User Interface

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The dashboard will be a web-based application that imports CSV data and transforms it into interactive visualizations. It will operate independently but may be integrated with existing data systems in the future.

### 2.2 Product Features
- CSV data import and validation
- Multiple visualization types (charts, graphs, tables)
- Data filtering and sorting capabilities
- Statistical analysis tools
- Export functionality for reports and visualizations
- User-customizable dashboard layouts

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **Data Analysts**: Primary users who need to perform in-depth analysis
- **Business Managers**: Need high-level insights and KPI tracking
- **Technical Users**: May need access to raw data and advanced features

## 3. Specific Requirements
