1.  **Project overview and scope:** Develop a minimal viable product (MVP) for a basic contact management web application, strictly limited to features achievable within a compressed 2-week timeline.
2.  **Primary objectives and success criteria:** The primary objective is to deliver a functional, single-user contact list application within the 2-week deadline; success is defined by the successful deployment of core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for contacts.
3.  **Key stakeholders and target users:** The key stakeholder is the project sponsor, and the target user is a single individual needing a simple, private digital address book.
4.  **Core functional requirements:** The system will support creating a new contact (name, email, phone), viewing a list of all contacts, editing an existing contact's details, and deleting a contact.
5.  **Technical stack recommendations:** Utilize a rapid development framework like React with a BaaS (Backend as a Service) like Firebase/Supabase to accelerate development and meet the aggressive timeline.
6.  **Data management approach:** Employ a simple, non-relational database (e.g., Firestore, Supabase DB) with a single 'contacts' collection, with no complex relationships.
7.  **Integration requirements with existing systems:** No external system integrations will be included in this 2-week scope to minimize complexity and risk.
8.  **Security and compliance considerations:** Basic input validation and environment variable management for credentials will be implemented; no user authentication will be in scope for this MVP.
9.  **Potential challenges or constraints:** The primary constraint is the extremely compressed 2-week timeline, which poses a significant risk to quality, testing, and feature completion.
10. **Quality assurance approach:** QA will be limited to developer-led manual feature testing and basic unit tests; no dedicated QA cycle or automated end-to-end testing is feasible.
