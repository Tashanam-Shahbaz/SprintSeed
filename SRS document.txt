1.  **Project Overview and Scope:** The project will create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a "Project Launch Countdown" application, drastically reducing the feature set from an original 8-week plan to fit the new 2-week timeline.
2.  **Primary Objectives and Success Criteria:** The sole objective is to deploy a core-functional application within 10 business days; success is defined by the live operation of the countdown timer and a basic task list.
3.  **Key Stakeholders and Target Users:** Stakeholders are the project leadership team, and users are internal team members who need to track the launch date and associated tasks.
4.  **Core Functional Requirements:** The system will feature a configurable countdown timer, a minimal CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) task list, and a single-user authentication model.
5.  **Technical Stack Recommendations:** A rapid-development stack like MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) or a serverless framework is required to meet the deadline.
6.  **Data Management Approach:** A simple NoSQL database will be used to store the target date, task items, and user credentials.
7.  **Integration Requirements with Existing Systems:** All external integrations, such as advanced email notifications or calendar syncs from the original plan, will be postponed to a future version.
8.  **Security and Compliance Considerations:** Basic security (HTTPS, password hashing) will be implemented, but comprehensive security audits are out of scope for this 2-week sprint.
9.  **Potential Challenges or Constraints:** The primary constraint is the hyper-compressed 2-week timeline, which eliminates any buffer for unforeseen issues and mandates a ruthless reduction in scope and testing.
10. **Quality Assurance Approach:** Testing will be limited to developer-led unit tests and a single, final user acceptance testing (UAT) session, forgoing any automated end-to-end or performance testing.
