1.  **Project Overview and Scope:** Develop a web-based project management application for creating, visualizing, and dynamically modifying project timelines.
2.  **Primary Objectives and Success Criteria:** The system's core function will be to allow users to compress or expand an entire project timeline (e.g., from 8 weeks to 2 weeks), with the system automatically recalculating all dependent task durations and deadlines.
3.  **Key Stakeholders and Target Users:** The primary users will be project managers, team leads, and executives who require agile planning and rapid rescheduling capabilities.
4.  **Core Functional Requirements:** Key features include a visual Gantt chart interface, drag-and-drop task management, a dedicated "Timeline Resizer" function, and automated dependency conflict warnings.
5.  **Technical Stack Recommendations:** A responsive frontend (e.g., React, Vue.js), a scalable backend (e.g., Node.js, Python), and a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) are recommended.
6.  **Data Management Approach:** All project, task, and dependency data will be stored in a structured relational database, ensuring data integrity during timeline modification operations.
7.  **Integration Requirements with Existing Systems:** Plan for future API-based integrations with common calendar services (Google Calendar, Outlook) and issue trackers (Jira).
8.  **Security and Compliance Considerations:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict timeline modification privileges and ensure all data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
9.  **Potential Challenges or Constraints:** The main technical challenge is creating a robust algorithm that can logically and proportionally adjust all task durations and dependencies when a timeline is drastically compressed.
10. **Quality Assurance Approach:** Testing will be heavily focused on validating the data integrity and logical correctness of the timeline recalculation engine under various scenarios.
